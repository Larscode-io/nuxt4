Six judges belong to the Dutch language group, six to the French language group. One of the judges must have an adequate knowledge of German. Each linguistic group is composed of three judges appointed on the basis of their legal experience (professor of law at a Belgian university, judicial officer at the Court of Cassation or the Council of State, legal secretary at the Constitutional Court) and three judges appointed on the basis of having at least five yearsâ€™ experience as Members of Parliament. The Court is composed of judges of both genders, at the rate of at least one third for the least numerous group, on the understanding that this group must be represented in both the aforementioned professional categories.

Candidates must be at least forty years old. The judges may hold office until the age of seventy. There are strict rules of incompatibility with other offices, posts and professional activities. The judges of each linguistic group elect a president. Both presidents preside in turn over the Court for a term of one year, commencing on 1 September.

See articles 31 to 34, 44 to 47 and 49 to 51 of the Special Act of 6 January 1989 on the Constitutional Court for further information.
