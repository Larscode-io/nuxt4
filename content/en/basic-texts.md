```Art. 6```

Provincial subdivisions can only be established by the law.

``` Art. 35 ```

The federal authority only has competences in the matters that are formally assigned to it by the Constitution and the laws passed by virtue of the
Constitution itself. <br/>
&emsp;The Communities and the Regions, each in its own field of concern, have
competences for the other matters, under the conditions and in the terms
stipulated by the law. This law must be adopted by a majority as described in
Article 4, last paragraph.

``` Transitional provision  ```

The law referred to in the second paragraph determines the date on

entry into force of the new article to be inserted in Title III of the Constitution,
which determines the competences exclusive to the federal authority.

``` Art. 36 ```

The federal legislative power is exercised jointly by the King, the House of
Representatives and the Senate

``` Art. 37 ```

The federal executive power, as regulated by the Constitution, belongs to
the King.

``` Art. 38 ```

Each Community has those powers which are recognised by the Constitution or by the laws passed by virtue of the Constitution.

must be passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph.

``` Art. 39 bis ```

Except for matters relating to finances or budget or matters that are regulated by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, matters attributed exclusively to regional bodies can be the subject of a referendum in the Region

&emsp;The rule referred to in Article 134 determines the procedures and arrangements for the referendum, and is adopted by a majority of two thirds of the

elections for the House of Representatives or a Community or Regional Parliament, and that is promulgated less than one year before the date on which
the legislative term is to come to an end, comes into force no sooner than

``` Art. 41 ```

Interests which are exclusively of a municipal or provincial nature are
ruled on by municipal or provincial councils, according to the principles laid
down by the Constitution. However, the rule referred to in Article 134 can
abolish the provincial institutions in implementation of a law passed by a
majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph. In such a case, the rule referred to in Article 134 can replace them by supra-municipal collectivities, the

to regulate matters of municipal interest. <br/>
&emsp;These intra-municipal territorial bodies are created in municipalities with
more than 100,000 inhabitants following the initiative of the municipal council. Their members are directly elected. In implementation of a law adopted
by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph, the federate law or rule
referred to in Article 134 regulates the other conditions and the way in which
such intra-municipal territorial bodies may be created. <br/>
&emsp;This federate law and the rule referred to in Article 134 can only be
adopted by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, under the condition that
the majority of the members of the Parliament concerned is present. <br/>
&emsp;Matters of municipal, supra-municipal or provincial interest can be the
subject of a referendum in the municipality, supra-municipal collectivity or
province concerned. The rule referred to in Article 134 regulates the procedures and arrangements for the referendum.

&emsp;In this case, Parliamentary procedure is suspended and the motion is referred to the Council of Ministers, which within thirty days gives its reasoned opinion on the motion and invites the House involved to pronounce on this opinion or on the Government bill or private member’s bill that, if need be, has been amended. <br/>
&emsp;This procedure can be applied only once by the members of a linguistic group with regard to the same Government bill or private member’s bill.

``` Art. 102 ```

In no circumstances may a written or oral order of the King exempt a minister from his accountability.

``` Art. 103 ```

Ministers are tried exclusively by the appeal court for offences they have allegedly committed in the exercise of their duties. The same rule applies in the case of offences allegedly committed by ministers outside the exercise of their duties and for which they are tried during the exercise of their duties. As the case may be, Articles 59 and 120 are not applicable. <br/>
&emsp;The law determines the manner of proceeding against them, both when they are prosecuted and when they are tried. <br/>
&emsp;The law designates the appeal court having jurisdiction, which sits in banc, and specifies its composition. The judgments of the appeal court can be appealed to the united chambers of the Supreme Court, which does not pronounce on the merits of the case. <br/>
&emsp;Only the public prosecutor to the appeal court that has jurisdiction may institute and lead criminal proceedings against a minister. <br/>
&emsp;Authorisation by the House of Representatives is required for any public prosecutor’s request to refer the minister concerned to a particular court or to discharge him, for his direct summons before the appeal court and, except in a case of a flagrant offence, for his arrest. <br/>

``` Transitional provision  ```

The present article is not applicable to acts which have been the subject of a preliminary judicial investigation or to proceedings instituted prior to the entry into force of the law implementing the article. <br/>
&emsp;In such a case, the following rule applies: the House of Representatives has the right to indict ministers and to bring them before the Supreme Court. Only the united chambers of this court have jurisdiction to try ministers in cases covered by the criminal laws and by application of the penalties prescribed by such laws. The Law of 17 December 1996 concerning the temporary and partial implementation of Article 103 of the Constitution remains applicable in such cases.

``` Art. 104 ```

The King appoints and dismisses the federal secretaries of State. <br/>
&emsp;These are members of the Federal Government. They do not form part of the Council of Ministers. They are deputies to a minister. <br/>
&emsp;The King determines their duties and the limits within which they may receive the right to countersign. <br/>

###### <span class="chapters"> CHAPTER VIII <br/> ON PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS</span>

``` Art. 162 ```

<p class="no-bottom-margin">Provincial and municipal institutions are regulated by the law. </p>

<p class="no-bottom-margin">The law guarantees the application of the following principles: </p>

1. the direct election of the members of provincial and municipal councils;
2. the attribution to provincial and municipal councils of all that is of provincial and municipal interest, without prejudice to the approval of their acts in the cases and in the manner that the law determines;
3. the decentralisation of competences to provincial and municipal institutions;
4. the public nature of provincial and municipal council meetings, within the limits established by the law;
5. the disclosure of accounts and budgets;
6. the intervention of the supervisory authority or of the federal legislative power to prevent the law from being violated or public interests from being harmed.

Supra-municipal collectivities are governed by the rule referred to in Article 134. This rule enshrines the application of the principles mentioned in the second paragraph. Other principles considered essential can be set by the rule referred to in Article 134, whether or not adopted by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, under the condition that the majority of the members of the Parliament concerned is present. Articles 159 and 190 are applicable to decisions and regulations of supra-municipal collectivities.” <br/>
&emsp;In accordance with a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph, the federate law or the rule referred to in Article 134 establishes the conditions and the manner in which several provinces, supra-municipal collectivities or municipalities can cooperate or form associations. However, provincial councils, councils of supra-municipal collectivities or municipal councils cannot be permitted to deliberate jointly.

``` Art. 163 ```

The competences exercised in the Flemish and Walloon Regions by elected provincial bodies are exercised, in the bilingual region of Brussels-Capital, by the Flemish and French Communities and by the Joint Community Commission, each with respect to matters falling under their responsibility in pursuance of Articles 127 and 128 and, with respect to other matters, by the Brussels-Capital Region. <br/>
&emsp;However, a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph establishes the detailed rules by which the Brussels-Capital Region or any institution whose members are designated by the latter exercise the competences described in the first paragraph which do not belong to those matters referred to in Article 39. A law adopted by the same majority lays down rules for the attribution to those institutions described in Article 136 of all or part of the competences referred to in the first paragraph that belong to those matters described in Articles 127 and 128.

``` Art. 164 ```

The drafting of registry office certificates relating to civil status and the maintenance of registers fall exclusively under the responsibility of the municipal authorities.

``` Art. 165 ```

§ 1. The law creates metropolitan districts and federations of municipalities. It determines their organisation and their competences and, when doing so, guarantees the application of the principles described in Article 162. <br/>
&emsp;Each metropolitan district has a council and an executive college. <br/>
&emsp;The president of the executive college is elected by the council from its midst; his election is ratified by the King; the law establishes his status. <br/>
&emsp;Articles 159 and 190 apply to the decisions and regulations of the metropolitan districts and the federations of municipalities. <br/>
&emsp;The boundaries of the metropolitan districts and of the federations of municipalities can only be changed or corrected by virtue of a law.

§ 2. The law creates the body within which each metropolitan district and the nearest federations of municipalities consult each other under the conditions and in the manner which the law establishes to examine common problems of a technical nature that fall under their respective competence.

§ 3. Several federations of municipalities may cooperate or form associations with each other or with one or more metropolitan districts in accordance with the conditions and in the manner prescribed by the law to jointly regulate and manage those issues that fall within their competence. Their councils are not permitted to deliberate jointly.

``` Art. 166 ```

§ 1. Article 165 applies to the metropolitan district to which the capital of the Kingdom belongs, with the exception of what is provided for hereinafter.

§ 2. The competences of the metropolitan district to which the capital of the Kingdom belongs are, in the manner determined by a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph, exercised by the bodies of the Brussels-Capital Region created by virtue of Article 39.

<p class="no-bottom-margin">§ 3. The bodies described in Article 136: </p>

1. possess, each for its Community, the same competences as the other organising powers with respect to cultural, educational and person-related matters;
2. exercise, each for its Community, the competences delegated to them by the Flemish Community Parliament and by the French Community Parliament;

This period shall begin on the day after the date of publication of the notice referred to in Article 74;
2. the Court has annulled a regulation entirely or partially covering the same subject and enacted by another legislative body than that which adopted the statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution.

assemblies at the request of two-thirds of their members, or any natural or legal person with a justifiable
interest shall have a new six-month period in which to institute an action for annulment of a statute,

the rules or articles of the Constitution referred to in Article 1. This period shall begin on the day after
the date of publication of the judgment in the *Moniteur belge*.

``` Art. 5 ```

Where the Court so deems necessary, it shall, by a general ruling, specify which effects of the nullified

###### <span class="sections"> SECTION II </br> EFFECTS OF ANNULMENT JUDGMENTS</span>

``` Art. 9 ```    

§ 1. The annulment judgments delivered by the Constitutional Court shall have final and binding
effect as from their publication in the *Moniteur belge*.

§ 2. The judgments delivered by the Constitutional Court whereby actions for annulment are dismissed
shall be binding on the courts with respect to the points of law settled by those judgments.

``` Art. 10 ```    

A final and conclusive judgment of a criminal court may be entirely or partially revoked by that
court insofar as the judgment in question is based on a provision of a statute, decree or rule referred to
in Article 134 of the Constitution which has been subsequently nullified by the Constitutional Court, or
on a regulation implementing such statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution.

``` Art. 11 ```    

It shall be for the Public Prosecution Service to demand such revocation.

The right to demand the revocation shall also be vested in:

1. the convicted person;
2. the person with regard to whom a decision has been given ordering deferment of the pronouncement of the judgment;
3. in the event that the convicted person or, where appropriate, the person with regard to whom a decision has been given ordering deferment of the pronouncement of the judgment has deceased or has been declared incompetent or absent, in his spouse, his direct descendants or ascendants, his brothers and sisters;
4. the party who has been declared liable under civil law for the convicted person or, where appropriate, the person with regard to whom a decision has been given ordering deferment of the pronouncement of the judgment.
<br/>

``` Art. 12 ```    

 § 1. The case shall be brought before the competent court, either at the suit of the Public
Prosecution Service, or by a petition stating the ground for revocation. On pain of nullity, the action
shall be instituted within six months after publication of the judgment of the Constitutional Court in the
*Moniteur belge*.

§ 2. After being seized of the case or of the petition, and in the event that the convicted person has
died, is absent or has been declared incompetent, that court shall appoint a guardian for his defence,
who shall represent him in the revocation proceedings.

§ 3. The Public Prosecution Service shall have the petition notified to all those who are party to the
challenged decision. The notification shall comprise a summons to appear before the court that
delivered the challenged decision, along with the text of Articles 10 to 12 of the present Act. The
decision whereby a final ruling is given on the revocation shall be deemed to have been delivered in
adversarial proceedings with respect to the validly summoned party claiming damages, even if this
party did not intervene in the action for revocation before the close of the proceedings.

§ 4. The case file on the basis of which the challenged decision was delivered shall be made available
for inspection by the parties for a period of at least fifteen days.

§ 5. The court that has been seized of the case may, if the convicted person has been taken into
custody in pursuance of the decision of which the revocation is being demanded, order that this person
be provisionally released in accordance with the procedure specified in Article 27, § 3, of the Act of 20
July 1990 on pre-trial detention. If the grounds adduced seem valid and are such as to justify the
requested revocation, that court may order the suspension of all measures for the execution or
enforcement of the decision that is susceptible of revocation.

§ 6. The court may, at the request of one the persons referred to in Article 11, 1° to 4°, order that its
revocation decision be published in abstract form in a newspaper which it designates.

§ 7. The costs of the proceedings shall be borne by the State.


``` Art. 13 ```  

§ 1. Judgments delivered in criminal cases on the basis of a nullified statute, nullified decree or
nullified rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution, or of a regulation implementing such statute,
decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution, as well as decisions to suspend the
pronouncement of such judgments shall be reversed by the revocation within the limits in which this
revocation was pronounced.

§ 2. If in the challenged decision only one sentence was passed in respect of several offences, of which
at least one had been committed in breach of a provision that has not been nullified, the court, at the
suit of the Public Prosecution Service and provided that the proceedings have not become barred by
limitation, may either uphold the judgment in its entirety or reduce the sentence, or suspend the
pronouncement of the judgment, or hand down a decision of acquittal.

§ 3. If the offences that led to the revoked judgment remain punishable by virtue of provisions that
become applicable again as a result of the annulment, the court that heard the action for revocation
may, at the suit of the Public Prosecution Service and provided that the proceedings have not become
barred by limitation, pass new sentences without however this resulting in an increase in penalties.

§ 4. The court shall order the repayment of any wrongfully collected fine, plus the legal interest accruing
from the date of collection. Article 28 of the Act of 13 March 1973 on compensation for wrongful pretrial detention shall also apply to convicted persons who have been wrongfully taken into custody in
pursuance of the revoked judgment.

§ 5. If, as a result of the revocation, the court is no longer competent to rule on the civil action, it shall
refer the case to the competent court. Articles 660 to 663 of the Judicial Code and Article 16, §§ 1 and
2, of the present Act shall also apply to such referral.

``` Art. 14 ```

Decisions to confine suspects and accused persons who are in a state of insanity, mental
disturbance or mental deficiency, which have been delivered by virtue of the Act on the protection of
society against abnormal persons or habitual criminals may be revoked in accordance with Articles 10
to 13.

``` Art. 15 ```    

Notwithstanding Article 1082, second paragraph, of the Judicial Code, a second appeal to the
Supreme Court may be brought if this relies exclusively upon the annulment by the Constitutional Court
of the provision of a statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution which
constituted the basis of the challenged decision, or of a regulation implementing such statute, decree or
rule

``` Art. 16 ```    

 § 1. A final and conclusive judgment of a civil court may be entirely or partially revoked at the
suit of the persons who were party to, or were duly summoned to appear in, those proceedings, insofar
as the judgment in question is based on a provision of a statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134
of the Constitution which has been subsequently nullified by the Constitutional Court, or on a regulation
implementing such statute, decree or rule.

§ 2. The court may, within the limits of the revocation, pronounce a new judgment based on a different
ground or on a different legal definition of an offence or an act substantiating the challenged decision.

§ 3. The action for revocation shall be brought before the court that delivered the challenged decision;
such action shall, on pain of nullity, be initiated by a summons setting out the grounds and notified to all
parties involved in the challenged decision.

§ 4. On pain of nullity, the action shall be instituted within six months after publication of the judgment
of the Constitutional Court in the *Moniteur belge*.

``` Art. 17 ```    

A judgment of the Council of State may be entirely or partially revoked, insofar as it is based on

subsequently nullified by the Constitutional Court, or on a regulation implementing such statute, decree
or rule.

The time limit for appeals shall be six months from the date of publication of the judgment of the
Constitutional Court in the *Moniteur belge*.

``` Art. 18 ```    

Notwithstanding the expiry of the time limits set by the laws and special regulations,
administrative or judicial appeals, as the case may be, may still be lodged against acts and regulations
of the various administrative bodies as well as against decisions of other courts of law than those
referred to in Article 16 of the present Act, insofar as those decisions are based on a provision of a
statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution which has been subsequently
nullified by the Constitutional Court, or on a regulation implementing such statute, decree or rule, within
six months after publication of the judgment of the Constitutional Court in the *Moniteur belge*.

<br/>

``` Art. 21 ```

challenged rule is liable to cause serious detriment which is difficult to remedy.

If the action is instituted by a separate document, it shall be dated and signed and shall specify the rule
against which the action for annulment is being instituted.

``` Art. 23 ```

Without prejudice to Articles 70 to 73, the Court shall rule on the action without delay in a duly

``` Art. 25 bis ```

The Court shall rule by way of judgments on actions for annulment, on the ground of
infringement of procedural requirements which are essential or breach of which leads to nullity, or of
abuse or misuse of powers, brought against decisions of the Review Committee referred to in Article
14/1 of the Act of 4 July 1989 on the limitation and control of election expenses for the elections of the
House of Representatives, the financing and open accounting of political parties.

For the investigation of such actions, the Court has the powers vested in it by Article 26, §§ 1 and 1*bis*.

``` Art. 25 ter ```

The actions referred to in Article 25*bis* shall be instituted by the elected candidate against
whom the Review Committee has pronounced a penalty decision.

Such actions shall only be admissible insofar as they are instituted within thirty days after notification of
the decision of the Review Committee. The limitation period for the actions referred to in the present
article shall only begin if the notification of the penalty decision by the Review Committee specifies the
existence of said action for annulment and the formalities and time limits to be observed. If this
condition is not fulfilled, the limitation period shall begin four months after the person concerned has
been notified of the decision of the Review Committee.

 Actions for annulment shall be instituted before the Court by means of a petition signed
by the elected candidate referred to in Article 25ter or by his lawyer.

###### <span class="chapters"> CHAPTER II: PRELIMINARY ISSUES </span>

``` Art. 26 ```

§ 1. The Constitutional Court shall, by way of preliminary ruling, settle in the form of judgments
issues relating to:

1. infringement by a statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution of the rules that have been established by or in pursuance of the Constitution to determine the respective powers of the State, the Communities and the Regions;
2. without prejudice to 1°, any conflict between decrees or between rules referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution that are enacted by different legislative bodies and insofar as the conflict has arisen from their respective scope of action;
3. infringement by a statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution of the articles of Title II, “The Belgians and their Rights”, and Articles 170, 172 and 191 of the Constitution.
4.  infringement by a statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution of article 143, §1, of the Constitution.
<br/>

§ 1*bis*. From the scope of this article shall be excluded the statutes, decrees and rules referred to in
Article 134 of the Constitution which ratify a treaty establishing the European Union or the Convention
of 4 November 1950 for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms or an Additional
Protocol to this Convention.

§ 2. Where a question relating to that matter is raised before a court of law, said court shall request the
Constitutional Court to give a ruling on that question.

The court of law, however, is not obliged to do so:

1. if the case cannot be heard by the court in question for reasons of lack of jurisdiction or inadmissibility of the case, unless those reasons are derived from rules in respect of which the request is made to refer a question for a preliminary ruling;
2. if the Constitutional Court has already ruled on a question or appeal on an identical subject.
<br/>

The court of law whose decision is open to appeal, opposition, appeal to the Supreme Court or action
for annulment before the Council of State, shall not be obliged to do so if the statute, decree or rule
referred to in Article 134 of the Constitution evidently does not infringe a rule or article of the
Constitution referred to in §1 or if the court of law believes that the reply to the preliminary question is
not essential to be able to pass judgment.

§ 3. Unless there is serious doubt about the compatibility of a statute, decree or rule referred to in
Article 134 of the Constitution with one of the rules or articles of the Constitution referred to in §1 and if
no question or appeal on the same subject is pending before the Constitutional Court, a court of law
shall not be obliged to refer a question for a preliminary ruling, both in the event that the action is urgent
and the judgment on the action is merely of a temporary nature, and in the event that the proceedings
are concerned with judging the necessity of keeping a suspect in pre-trial detention.

§ 4. Where it is invoked before a court of law that a statute, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 of
the Constitution infringes a fundamental right which is guaranteed in an entirely or partly similar manner
by a provision of Title II of the Constitution and by a provision of European or international law, said
court of law shall first refer the question of compatibility with the provision of Title II of the Constitution
to the Constitutional Court for a preliminary ruling. Where only the infringement of the provision of European or international law is invoked before the court of law, said court of law shall, even ex officio,
investigate whether Title II of the Constitution contains an entirely or partly similar provision. These
obligations shall not prejudice the right of the court of law, at the same time or at a later date, to refer a
question to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph, the obligation to refer a preliminary question to the Constitutional
Court shall not apply:

1. in the cases referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3;
2. if the court of law finds that the provision of Title II of the Constitution has manifestly not been infringed;
3. if the court of law finds that it appears from a judgment delivered by an international court of law that the provision of European or international law has manifestly been infringed;
4. if the court of law finds that it appears from a judgment delivered by the Constitutional Court that the provision of Title II of the Constitution has manifestly been infringed.
<br/>

``` Art. 27 ```

§ 1. Preliminary questions shall be referred to the Constitutional Court by communication of a
certified true copy of the referral decision signed by the president and registrar of the court of law.

§ 2. The referral decision shall state the provisions of the statute, decree or rule referred to in Article
134 of the Constitution in respect of which the question is referred; where appropriate, it shall also
specify which articles of the Constitution or of the special laws are relevant in that respect. The
Constitutional Court, however, may reformulate the preliminary question referred.

``` Art. 28 ```

The court of law which posed the preliminary question and any other court of law passing
judgment in the same case shall comply with the ruling given by the Constitutional Court in the
settlement of the dispute in connection with which the questions referred to in Article 26 were posed.

Where the Court so deems necessary, it shall, by a general ruling, specify which effects of the
provisions which have been declared unconstitutional are to be considered maintained or be
provisionally maintained for the period appointed by the Court.

``` Art. 29 ```

§ 1. No legal remedy shall lie against a decision of a court of law insofar as it refers a question
to the Constitutional Court for a preliminary ruling.

§ 2. Any decision whereby a court of law refuses to refer a question for a preliminary ruling shall state
the reason for the refusal. No separate legal remedy shall lie against the decision of a court of law that
refuses to refer such a question.

``` Art. 30 ```

A decision to refer a question to the Constitutional Court for a preliminary ruling shall have the
effect of suspending the proceedings and the time limits for proceedings and limitation periods from the
date of that decision until the date on which the ruling of the Constitutional Court is notified to the court
of law that posed the preliminary question. A copy of the ruling shall be sent to the parties.

The court of law may, however, even ex officio, take the necessary provisional measures to ensure
protection of the rights that are granted by European Union law.

###### <span class="chapters"> CHAPTER III: COMMON PROVISIONS</span>

well as the conditions and specific rules set out by or in pursuance of Article 39*bis* of the Constitution
have been complied with.

comments, if any, formulated by the President of the Regional Parliament, and the administrative file.
This administrative file shall be sent together with a list of documents it contains.

The Constitutional Court shall rule on the petition within sixty days after submission thereof.

If the referendum fails to comply with any one of the statutes, decrees, conditions or specific rules
referred to in Article 1, or if the matter is not referred to the Constitutional Court first, the referendum
shall not be held. The referendum cannot be held as long as the Court has not given its ruling.

``` Art. 69 ```

 There shall be a restricted chamber, composed of the president and the two judgesrapporteurs.

``` Art. 70 ```

Immediately upon receipt of an action for annulment or a referral decision, the judgesrapporteurs shall examine whether upon investigation of the petition or the referral decision it is clear
that the action or the preliminary question is manifestly inadmissible or unfounded, that the action or
preliminary question manifestly falls outside the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court, or that the case
can be settled with a judgment delivered after a preliminary procedure.

``` Art. 71 ```

If the action for annulment or the preliminary question is manifestly inadmissible or manifestly
falls outside the jurisdiction of the Court, the judges-rapporteurs shall report on this to the president
within a maximum term of thirty days after receipt of the petition or the referral decision; if the
challenged rule is also the subject of an action for suspension, this term shall be reduced to maximum
fifteen days.

The conclusions of the judges-rapporteurs shall be notified to the parties by the registrar within the time
limit stipulated in the first paragraph. The parties shall have fifteen days from the date of receipt of the
notification to submit a written statement of justification.

The restricted chamber may then decide by a unanimous vote to settle the case without any further
judicial procedure by a judgment dismissing the action or the question or establishing that the Court
has no jurisdiction to try the case.

If the proposal to deliver a judgment of inadmissibility or lack of jurisdiction is not adopted, the restricted
chamber shall establish this by order.

``` Art. 72 ```

 If the judges-rapporteurs consider that the action for annulment is manifestly unfounded, the
preliminary question evidently calls for a negative reply, or the case, owing to its very nature or the
relatively straightforward nature of the issues raised therein, can be settled with a judgment delivered
after a preliminary procedure, they shall report on this to the Court within a maximum term of thirty days
after receipt of the petition or the referral decision; if the challenged rule is also the subject of an action
for suspension, this term shall be reduced to maximum fifteen days.

The conclusions of the judges-rapporteurs shall be notified to the parties by the registrar within the time
limit stipulated in the first paragraph. If the judges-rapporteurs suggest in their conclusions that the
Court deliver a judgment establishing that the rules referred to in Articles 1 and 26 have been infringed,
this shall be notified to the parties referred to in Article 76 together with the action for annulment or the
decision containing the preliminary question. The parties shall have fifteen days from the date of receipt
of the notification to submit a written statement of justification.

The Court may then decide that the case should be settled without any further judicial procedure by a
judgment declaring the action well-founded or unfounded, or giving a positive or negative reply to the
question, as the case may be.

If the proposal to deliver a judgment after a preliminary procedure is not adopted, the Court shall
establish this by order.

``` Art. 73 ```

The judgments referred to in Articles 71, third paragraph, and 72, third paragraph, shall be
notified to the parties.

referral decision, the registrar shall notify the action for annulment to the parties in the lawsuit before
the court of law that referred the preliminary question. The notification shall specify the time limit within

``` Art. 95 ```   

If a party pleads that a submitted document is a forgery, the party who submitted the document
shall be requested by the Court to declare forthwith whether said party persists in its intention to make
use of that document.

If the party fails to act on this request or declares that it does not wish to make use of the document,
the document shall be rejected.

If the party declares that it wishes to make use of the document and this document is essential to the
resolution of the dispute, the Court shall suspend the lawsuit until the competent court of law has ruled
on the forgery. Said court of law shall give priority to this issue over all other cases. If the dispute has
not been brought before any court of law, the Court shall rule on the probative force of the document.

If judgment can be passed without the allegedly forged document having to be taken into consideration,
the legal proceedings shall be continued.

If one of the parties to a lawsuit before a court of law that has referred a preliminary question

The fact that a judge of the Court has taken part in the formulation of a statute, decree or rule referred
to in Article 134 of the Constitution which is the subject of an action for annulment or a referral decision
shall not in itself constitute a ground for recusal.

Any judge of the Court who is aware of the existence of a ground for recusal against him shall notify the
Court thereof, which shall decide whether he should abstain from the case.

``` Art. 102 ```  

 Any party who intends to recuse a judge shall do so as soon as it has knowledge of the
