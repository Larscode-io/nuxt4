### Administrative staff

The Court has its own administrative staff. It appoints and dismisses staff members.

In addition to the secretariats of the judges, the administrative staff is divided into a number of specialized departments:

- the registry. Under the authority of the registrars, the registry receives procedural documents (appeals, preliminary questions, pleadings) and ensures that they are notified to the right persons;
- the translation service. This service translates internal documents of the Court (in particular, draft judgments, documentary notes or internal reports) into French, Dutch and/or German. It also includes revisers, who ensure that judgments are proofread and checked for linguistic consistency before publication;
- the BIB-DOCU service. This service manages the Court's library and documentation. The BIB-DOCU service is responsible for monitoring the relevant legal doctrine, purchasing books and electronic sources, and managing and developing various internal databases establishing links between case-law, doctrine and cases pending before the Court. The service assists the magistrates in the handling of cases and their documentary needs;
- the data service. This service is responsible for the database relating to the Court's case law. This database systematizes the Court's case law in key words and summaries and is publicly accessible on the Court's website. The data service also ensures the publication of judgments on the Court's website;
- the IT service. This service is responsible for the management, maintenance and development of the computer technology necessary for the functioning of the Court, including databases and the Court's website.

As of today, the administrative staff consists of approximately 50 members.
