### Legal secretaries

The Court is assisted by legal secretaries

Half of the legal secretaries are Dutch-speakers and the other half are French-speakers. At least one French-speaking legal secretary and one Dutch-speaking legal secretary must have a sufficient knowledge of German.

Legal secretaries are magistrates with a university degree in law and must be at least 25 years old when they are selected. They are appointed by the Court on the basis of an open competition, the terms and conditions of which are determined by the Court. There can be 24 legal secretaries at most. From January 1st 2021 onwards there are 20 of them.

The Special Act does not explicitly define the tasks of the legal secretaries. They are called upon to assist the Court in all its functions. Their main task is to draft judgments in cases before the Court, under the supervision of the judge to whom they are attached. When a new question for a preliminary ruling or a new appeal comes before the Court, they carry out an initial examination of the new case and propose, where appropriate, the implementation of a short procedure. In other cases, they draw up draft judgments on the basis of which the judges will deliberate. They also assist the Court by drafting notes, amendments or “alternative” draft judgments. Legal secretaries do not take part in the deliberations. Finally, they also carry out tasks relating to the Court's documentation, internal functioning and external relations.

See articles 35 to 39, 44 to 47, 50 and 51 of the Special Act of 6 January 1989 on the Constitutional Court for further information.
