### Registrars

The Court has one French-speaking and one Dutch-speaking registrar. They are appointed by the King from two lists of two candidates each, presented respectively by the French-speaking and Dutch-speaking judges of the Court.

The registrars must have a university degree in law and must be at least 30 years of age and meet the requirements set out in article 41 of the Special Act of 6 January 1989.

The registrars assist the Court in the exercise of its jurisdictional function, at all stages of the procedure.

They see to the follow-up of the procedure in all cases, from the registration of these, through the notification of written proceedings and assistance at hearings, up to the co-signing of judgments, their notification and their publication.

They authenticate all official Court documents.

They assist the Court in its meetings, work and decision-making of an administrative nature.
They take part in the various commissions and working groups organized within the Court.

Registrars are responsible for the general administrative coordination of administrative services and have authority over staff. They are directly in charge of the registry service.

Under the authority of the Court and its presidents, they manage the human, material and financial resources of the Court.

See articles 40 and 41, 44 to 46, 50, 51 and 61 of the Special Act of 6 January 1989 on the Constitutional Court for further information.
