### 1\. Electronic communication

The <a href="https://www.const-court.be/public/base/nl/BW_LS_2014_04_04.pdf" aria-label="Click on the link to download the pdf" target="blank"> Special Act of 4 April 2014 amending the Special Act of 6 January 1989 on the Constitutional Court</a> makes it possible to introduce electronic litigation, allowing the communications required in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court (the filing of petitions and the sending of procedural documents by the parties, and the sending of notices, communications and summonses by the Registry) to take place via an electronic platform (article 78bis of the Special Act of 6 January 1989). For this purpose, the Court will use the electronic system of the Department of Justice, which offers an equivalent to the traditional paper-based registered mail.


### 2\. The entry into force

The entry into force of the electronic litigation before the Constitutional Court will be determined by royal decree. Pending this royal decree, it is currently not yet possible to file documents with the Court electronically.
